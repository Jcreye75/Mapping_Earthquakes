# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of the analysis:
Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

## What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:
- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

## Resources
- Software: Git version 2.33.0.windows.2, Visual Studio 1.62.2, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON

## Deliverables:
1. Map 1: Street View with Earthquakes, Tectonic Plate data and Major Earthquakes (Seleccionable)
